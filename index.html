								<h2> Bonding</h2>
								
					<img src="http://www.thehairextensionboutique.co.uk/images/user_images/hair-extensions-micro-bonds-3.jpg">
		<p> Bonding is a popular temporary weaving method and a great way to add volume or vibrant streaks of color to your natural hair. 
		Tracks of hair are glued to the roots of your own hair with a special adhesive. To prevent damage to your natural hair, tracks shouldn't be left for any longer than a week or two.
		Bonding may also refer to the attachment of toupees (and custom wigs)with a medical grade adhesive. 
		There are 2 types of bond: soft bond which dries in the consistency of rubber glue and hard bond which dries to the consistency of crazy glue. 
		Hard bond is only recommended for the small number of people for which soft bond does not hold properly. 
		These permanent bond attachments generally last 4â€“6 weeks before a maintenance appointment is necessary.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3>Tracks<h3>

			<p>In tracking, natural tresses are first braided around the head in concentric circles. 
			The braids are sewn down, then extensions are sewn to the braids. 
			Eight to fifteen tracks are needed for a full head.
			Care for this style as you would your natural hair, washing at least once a week.

To sew the weave hair, the stylist must first braid the hair into cornrows.
 The hair may also be braided into a zig-zag shape to make things easier and quicker. 
 The wearer may leave out a section of hair if she or he wants a part or half the hair weaved.
 So the hair won't appear lumpy, the hair is sewn horizontally across the head from one side to the other, starting from the bottom. 
 If the hair is to have a parting, it is recommended that a weft of hair be glued as close as possible to a part in the hair that separates the braids and the hair that the wearer left out.
 After those steps are finished, the wearer can have the weave hair cut or styled however she or he wants, with her or his own hair blending in. </p>
 
 
 
 
						<h4>Fusion</h4>

						<p>The fusion method delivers one of the most versatile and most natural-looking weaves on the market.
						With this technique, a machine similar to a hot glue gun is used to adhere human hair extensions to individual strands of one's natural hair (about the same size as a micro braid) for a truly authentic look.
						With a fusion weave, you can wash your hair every week and use products like gels and mousse to style.
						This is one of the most time-consuming (8 to 16 hours) and expensive methods (prices range from about $800 to $1,800).

To use a heating appliance, individual strands of hair are used. 
Hair is sectioned out as if the client were getting skinny individual braids.
 The appliance is heated to the correct temperature.
 The stylist attaches a section of the human hair to the client's sectioned hair. 
 Depending on the style, a half head of fused hair could take about 20 sections. 
 A full head could use about 50 sections.
 It is recommended that a trained and certified stylist use this technique because of potential hair loss and possible burning of the skin by the appliance.

Recently, cold-fusion extensions made of 100% human hair (no yak-hair dilution) have been introduced.
 These hair extensions do not require any heating elements, as the intense heat used to apply traditional hair extensions may damage them.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
					<h5> No Braids No Glue </h5>
					
					<img src="http://www.roccoandco.com/photos/1732-1.jpg">
					
					<p>NoBraidsNoGlue is two pieces of thread are integrated into the natural tresses.
					Then the commercial hair is integrated into thread with two pieces of thread. 
					It is based on "suspension bridge engineering": trusses and bridges are made with the thread. 
					There is little damage with this technique because the stress is diffused throughout the foundation. 
					This also means large sections of hair loss can easily be covered. It takes 45 minutes to 1 hour for a full head.
					Care for this style as you would your natural hair, washing at least every 7-14 days. Because there are no braids there are no lumps. 
					The hair is sewn horizontally starting from the bottom. After these basic steps are finished, the wearer can pull the hair into a ponytail because all of his natural hair is out and blended in.</p>
					
					
					
					<h6>Netting</h6>
					
					<img src="http://www.hypehair.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/net-weave-hypehair.jpg">
					
					<p>Netting is a technique which involves braiding natural tresses under a thin, breathable net that serves as a flat surface onto which stylists can weave extensions.
					Netting provides more flexibility than track placement because the stylist is not limited to sewing extensions to a braid. 
					This style can last for up to three months if properly maintained. To care for your hair, wash it once a week and invest in a hooded hair dryer or heated cap for at-home maintenance
					. "You want to make sure your hair is completely dry so it will not mildew under the net at all.</p>
